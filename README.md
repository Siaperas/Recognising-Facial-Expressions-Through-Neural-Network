# Recognising-Facial-Expressions-Through-Neural-Network
A neural network is a system that can be used to classify input data to different labels. It performs classification by learning a function that maps inputs to corresponding labels. The network is represented by a set of neurons that are connected with weights that can be adjusted to optimise the classification performance. In this project, we aim to train a neural network that categorises the six basic human expressions, namely: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise. By using AU (Action Unit) data as our input, representing the activation/deactivation of visible facial muscle, and by testing different algorithms for learning while optimising their respective parameters, we aim to find the optimal combination of learning algorithm and parameters and thus the optimal neural network that classifies a given input set of examples. The trained neural network will then be tested on test data to evaluate its classification performance. The goal is to be able to classify unseen data into the appropriate human expression accurately.
